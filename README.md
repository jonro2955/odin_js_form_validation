This is a browser form which collects Email, Country, Zip Code, Password and Password Confirmation fields. It uses regular expressions, live inline validation, and the JS constraint validation API to test and alert the user whether a field is properly filled in or not. It highlights a field and provides helpful error messages until it has been filled in properly. It gives an error message if the submit button is pushed with any errors or unfilled required fields.
